## Flying

### Syracuse (SYR)

If you are flying into Syracuse airport we are providing transportation to the hotel (and back on Friday). Based on survey information, we have three buses. They depart from SYR at 1 pm, 5 pm and 11 pm. While the 1 pm bus is nearly full, there is ample room on the later buses in case you forgot to share your travel plans or are delayed.

Regardless of which terminal you arrive at, the buses will pick you up in the Terminal A arrivals area:

Syracuse airport terminal maps are available [here](https://syrairport.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/First-Floor-White-Digital-Summer-2024-scaled.jpg) and show the direction to terminal A arrivals. Buses should have a sign for the Householder Symposium.

If necessary due to changes in your travel, Uber and [Collegetown Cab](https://collegetowncab.com/) are potential, albeit expensive, options as well. 

### Ithaca (ITH)

If you are flying into Ithaca airport and shared your travel information with us the hotel will be providing transportation. They have your flight numbers and arrival times to plan accordingly. If any issues arise or you are unexpectedly delayed, please contact the hotel directly at 607-254-2500.

## The Statler Hotel

Check-in time for the [Statler Hotel](https://statlerhotel.cornell.edu/) is 16:00. If you arrive earlier, they should be able to hold your luggage so you can explore the surrounding area (see our page on [local information](/local/)). However, Cornell's reunion is the weekend before the Symposium and the hotel is fully booked on Saturday night. So, I suspect it will not be possible to check in earlier.

## Registration

From 4 - 8 pm on June 8 we will have a table set up in the Hotel lobby for registration. You can collect your name badge and welcome bag there. If you are checking into the hotel later they should have your welcome bag at the front desk.
