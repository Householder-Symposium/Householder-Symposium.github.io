## Inclusiveness

All participants should expect and demand to be treated with respect. The Householder symposium will provide a climate that is welcoming and comfortable to all participants and encourages the open expression and exchange of ideas free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. The symposium maintains a strict zero-tolerance stance toward all forms of harassment, including sexual harassment. If you observe behavior inconsistent with these principles or feel harassed or unsafe in any way, please bring it to the attention of the conference organizers. 

Conference participants who experience or witness any problematic behavior may submit a complaint through several clearly defined channels: (1) Cornell police (tel: 607-255-1111), (2) Report the incident to Cornell on the [web](https://share.cornell.edu/report/reporting-to-the-university/), or (3) Speak with the organizers (Anil Damle](mailto:damle@cornell.edu), [Alex Townsend](mailto:ajt253@cornell.edu), and [David Bindel](mailto:bindel@cornell.edu)). All complaints will be reviewed promptly and impartially, and we will maintain confidentiality to the greatest extent possible while ensuring the safety and well-being of the conference participants. Resolutions may involve warnings, suspension of privileges, or expulsion from the conference if warranted by the severity of the infraction.


The symposium subscribes to the [SIAM statement on equity, diversity, and inclusion](https://www.siam.org/about-siam/policies-guidelines/detail/statement-on-inclusiveness), the [ILAS welcoming and inclusiveness statement](https://ilasic.org/inclusiveness-statement/), and the [Cornell Computer Science Departmentâ€™s Values of Inclusion](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/diversity-inclusion/values-inclusion).
