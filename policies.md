## Inclusiveness

All participants should expect and demand to be treated with respect. 
The Householder symposium will provide a climate that is welcoming and comfortable to all participants and encourages the open expression and exchange of ideas free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. If you observe behavior inconsistent with these principles or feel harassed or unsafe in any way please bring it to the attention of the conference organizers. 

The symposium subscribes to the [SIAM statement on equity, diversity, and inclusion](https://www.siam.org/about-siam/policies-guidelines/detail/statement-on-inclusiveness), the [ILAS welcoming and inclusiveness statement](https://ilasic.org/inclusiveness-statement/), and the [Cornell Computer Science Departmentâ€™s Values of Inclusion](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/diversity-inclusion/values-inclusion).
