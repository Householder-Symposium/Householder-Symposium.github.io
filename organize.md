The Householder Committee seeks a team to organize the 2025
Householder Symposium on Numerical Linear Algebra. The deadline for
submitting a proposal is June 1, 2025.

Proposals should be submitted via email to [householderxxii@cornell.edu](mailto:householderxxii@cornell.edu)


Please note: Proposals by professional congress and convention bureaus
will not be considered. No contact information about local members of
our community will be provided.

## Guidelines for proposals
 
The Householder Committee is responsible for reviewing proposals to organize a Householder Symposium. The Chair of the Householder Committee will be responsible for convening meetings to discuss all received proposals, and communicating decisions to proposers. If a member of the Householder Committee is involved with one of the proposals, this should be considered a conflict-of-interest, and that member will be recused from all discussions and voting.

The following items provide some general guidelines about issues to consider when preparing a proposal for hosting a Householder Symposium.

- The location should be somewhat remote, but at the same time travel should not be too complicated for participants. 
- Proposed dates should be reasonable, and should not overlap other important conferences. In particular, be aware of meetings organized by SIAM, GAMM, and ILAS, as well as the Biennial Conference on Numerical Analysis.
- The Householder Symposium begins with a welcome reception on Sunday evening, and concludes with lunch on Friday.
- Be able to accomodate approximately 150-180 participants.
- The local organizing committee (LOC) is an important consideration, with a designated "Chair". Provide a list of names, affiliations, and contact information for each member of the LOC. The LOC Chair should be reliable and responsive.
- The LOC should provide some assurances that they have a reliable team of "workers" to help with meeting logistics.
- The facility should have enough sleeping rooms to hold all participants, including single and double occupancy.
- There should be sufficient dining space for all participants.
- or plenary lectures, there must be one lecture room large enough for all participants, preferably classroom style seating.
- For parallel sessions, there should be at least 2 smaller break-out rooms for approximately 80 participants, preferably classroom style seating.
- For poster sessions, there should be a comfortable and centrally located space for about 100 posters, and availability of poster boards. Optionally, it could be proposed to have more than one poster session on separate days (e.g., 50 one day, 50 another day).
- There should be a large bar area or lounge (for impromptu and evening meetings), with reasonable alcohol policies.
- The facility should have complementary WiFi with fast and reliable 24/7 response, which can simultaneously handle all participants.
- The facility should have a high quality A/V system with on-staff technician. Note that A/V  includes audio - please make sure there is a good microphone system and/or good acoustics in the lecture rooms.
- Outline of possible activities for a half day excursion. There could be multiple choices, but the activities should be able to accommodate all participants.
- A reasonable cost estimate should be provided, including: 
	- Sleeping rooms with complimentary WiFi. 
	- Meeting rooms plus 2 coffee breaks per day. 
	- 3 meals per day, a welcome reception and a banquet. 
	- Rental of poster boards, A/V system and technician. 
	- Excursion.
- Provide examples of possible sources of external funding to help support the meeting. This would likely include a proposal to the U.S. National Science Foundation to help cover travel and lodging expenses for student and early career participants. If the proposed symposium is in the U.S., then it is expected that the LOC will write and submit the NSF proposal. If the symposium is outside the U.S., the LOC should work with U.S. representatives on the Householder Committee who will be responsible for writing and submitting the NSF proposal.
