Here is some information that you may find of interest during your stay (particularly if you are staying in Ithaca for longer than just the meeting). The hotel staff should also be able to help if you have questions during your stay. You can also contact the organizers with any questions you may have.

## Local needs

### Necessities

There is a small gift shop within the Statler Hotel and the [Cornell Store](https://www.cornellstore.com/) across the street is also available. 

### Medical care

In the event of an emergency dial 911. For non-emergency situations there are numerous urgent care clinics in Ithaca that we can help arrange transport to; the hotel can also provide guidance/assistance. In addition, Cornell Health maintains a [vending machine](https://health.cornell.edu/services/pharmacy/vending) that stocks non-prescription medications and supplies, and is located [close to the hotel](https://health.cornell.edu/get-care/getting-here). 

### Shopping (food)

The closest market to the hotel is [GreenStar Food Co+op in Collegetown](https://greenstar.coop/collegetown/); it is about a half mile walk. They are open from 9:00 till 23:00 daily.

## Fitness

### The hotel

The hotel has a small fitness center located off of the lobby.

### Running 

There are plenty of great running options leaving from the hotel; we have provided [a collection of suggested routes](/running/). Ithaca is hilly, so you can end up collecting some elevation if you wish.

### Walking

If you wish to get out for a scenic walk near the hotel we recommend checking out the [Cascadilla Gorge Trail](https://www.gofingerlakes.org/locations/cascadilla-gorge-trail/) from campus to downtown. (It is currently closed for construction but will hopefully reopen by June.) Other good options nearby are to take a stroll around [Beebe Lake](https://cornellbotanicgardens.org/location/beebe-lake-and-woods/) or wander over to the [F.R. Newman Arboretum](https://cornellbotanicgardens.org/explore/in-f-r-newman-arboretum/).


### Cycling

The area around Cornell has exceptional road cycling. Unfortunately, there are no good local options for renting road bikes; if you want to explore bring your own. We are happy to provide routes, this [website](https://sites.google.com/view/cyclingithaca/home) is a good starting point.

## Points of interest

### Overlooks
For scenic views over Ithaca we recommend walking over to the Cornell University Slope; you can use [Uris Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/r3TXGghJENGYQYAW8) as a landmark. Within Uris Library, the [A. D. White Library](https://exhibits.library.cornell.edu/a-d-white-library-tour) is quite nice.

### Museums
If you have time, we recommend a trip to the [Johnson Museum of Art](https://museum.cornell.edu/); it is a short walk from the Hotel. The museum has a variety of interesting collections and also features spectacular views from the upper floors.
