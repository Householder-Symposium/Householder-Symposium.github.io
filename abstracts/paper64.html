Abstract

</div>

<p>
Recurrences building orthonormal bases for polynomial Krylov spaces with nonsymmetric matrices have been classically used for approximation purposes in various numerical linear algebra contexts. Variants aiming to limit memory and
computational costs by using truncated recurrences usually have convergence limitations. Recently, randomized linear algebra strategies have been devised that drastically improve the performance of these variants, while keeping the costs low. We
provide a unifying framework for analyzing these randomized methods, based on Krylov decompositions [4]. This framework allows us to identify the key quantities – the canonical angles among the basis vectors – for assessing the effectiveness of the
randomized strategy. Moreover, it also allows us to analyze the spectral properties of the obtained reduced matrices. Our results are illustrated with experiments using the nonsymmetric Lanczos iteration, which is inherently a three-term recurrence,
so that no truncation is performed. Hence, randomized procedures applied to the Lanczos method may be viewed as a way to stabilize the approximation.
