Abstract

</div>

<p>
Many nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs) arise from discretizing an infinite-dimensional problem. In fact, 25 out of the 52 NEPs from the benchmark NLEVP collection arise from discretizing a continuous problem such as a differential eigenvalue
problem&nbsp; [1]. Traditional analysis typically focuses on solving the resulting finite-dimensional NEP after discretization. However, as I will reveal in this talk with many examples (including the NLEVP), discretizing an infinite-dimensional NEP
can introduce fundamental issues, often overlooked, that impact the core of eigenvalue computations. Discretization may distort, destabilize, or even destroy the essential eigenvalues, leading to inaccurate representations of the continuous problem.
</p>

<p>
I will show how to overcome these dangers and present simple, yet general, stable, and practical convergent algorithms [2]. This includes methods for computing pseudospectra with error control and, in regions of discrete spectra, for computing
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of holomorphic infinite-dimensional NEPs. Additionally, I will prove the optimality of these algorithms, employing a rigorous unified framework that proves what can and cannot be achieved.
</p>

<p>
The dangers described also apply to linear problems, so here is a warm-up example:

methods. The operator \(S\) is unitary, and hence normal, and its spectrum is the unit circle. If we truncate this operator to \(\mathrm {span}\{e_{-n},\ldots ,e_n\}\), corresponding to partial Fourier series, we obtain a \((2n+1)\times

<p>
Given a domain (a non-empty, open, and connected subset) \(\Omega \subset \mathbb {C}\) and a matrix-valued function \(F:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb {C}^{n\times n}\), the matrix NEP consists of finding eigenvalues \(\lambda \in
\Omega \) and nonzero eigenvectors \(v\in \mathbb {C}^n\) so that \(F(\lambda )v=0\). Many of these matrix NEPs are derived from discretizing the following type of infinite-dimensional NEP. Consider two separable Hilbert spaces \(\mathcal
{H}_1\) and \(\mathcal {H}_2\) with inner products \(\langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle _{\mathcal {H}_j}\) and norms \(\|\cdot \|_{\mathcal {H}_j}\), and a scalar-dependent operator
</p>

<p>
\[ T(\lambda ):\mathcal {D}(T)\supseteq \mathcal {H}_1\rightarrow \mathcal {H}_2, \quad \lambda \in \Omega . \]
</p>

<p>
For each fixed \(\lambda \), \(T(\lambda )\) is a closed and densely-defined linear operator acting on the Hilbert space \(\mathcal {H}_1\). However, we allow nonlinear dependence on the parameter \(\lambda \). We assume that \(T(\lambda
)\) has a fixed densely-defined domain \(\mathcal {D}(T)\subset \mathcal {H}_1\) and the map \(\Omega \ni \lambda \mapsto T(\lambda )u\in \mathcal {H}_2\) is holomorphic for each fixed \(u\in \mathcal {D}(T)\). The
<i>spectrum</i> of \(T\), denoted by \(\Lambda (T)\), is the set of points \(\lambda \in \Omega \) such that \(T(\lambda ):\mathcal {D}(T)\rightarrow \mathcal {H}_2\) is not boundedly invertible. Often, we wish to find eigenvalues
\(\lambda \in \mathbb {C}\) and nonzero eigenfunctions \(u\in \mathcal {D}(T)\) such that

<p>
Pseudospectra provide insight into the stability of linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems&nbsp; [4]. Consider the set of bounded holomorphic perturbations of \(T\) of norm at most \(\epsilon &gt;0\), i.e.,
</p>

<p>
\[\setlength \abovedisplayskip {6pt}\setlength \belowdisplayskip {6pt} \mathcal {A}(\epsilon )=\left \{E:\Omega \rightarrow \mathcal {B}(\mathcal {H}_1,\mathcal {H}_2) \text { holomorphic}\, \Big \vert \, \sup
_{z\in \Omega }\|E(z)\|&lt;\epsilon \right \}, \]
</p>

<p>
where \(\mathcal {B}(\mathcal {H}_1,\mathcal {H}_2)\) denotes the space of bounded linear maps from \(\mathcal {H}_1\) to \(\mathcal {H}_2\). The \(\epsilon \)-pseudospectrum of \(T\) is the following union of spectra of perturbed
operators:
</p>

<p>
\[\setlength \abovedisplayskip {6pt}\setlength \belowdisplayskip {6pt} \Lambda _{\epsilon }(T)= \bigcup _{E\in \mathcal {A}(\epsilon )}\Lambda (T+E). \]
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, we have
</p>

<p>
\[\setlength \abovedisplayskip {6pt}\setlength \belowdisplayskip {6pt} \Lambda _{\epsilon }(T)=\left \{z\in \Omega \, \big \vert \, \|T(z)^{-1}\|^{-1}&lt;\epsilon \right \}, \]
</p>

<p>
where we define \(\|T(z)^{-1}\|^{-1}=0\) if \(z\in \Lambda (T)\). This leads to a method for computing \(\Lambda _{\epsilon }(T)\) that avoids discretization issues. Let \(\{\mathcal {P}_n\}\) and \(\{\mathcal {Q}_n\}\) be sequences of
increasing finite-rank orthogonal projections on \(\mathcal {H}_1\) and \(\mathcal {H}_2\), respectively, such that \(\lim _{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal {P}_n^*\mathcal {P}_nu=u\) for any \(u\in \mathcal {H}_1\) and \(\lim
_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal {Q}_n^*\mathcal {Q}_nv=v\) for any \(v\in \mathcal {H}_2\). We consider the following function:

The first method should be preferred over the second wherever possible since it avoids the loss of precision owing to the square root. In some situations, the second method seems unavoidable&nbsp; [7].

In addition to stability, pseudospectra have several other uses. For example, we use them to prove convergence of the contour method described in the next section, and one can use pseudospectra to compute spectra by taking the additional limit

Contour methods provide a powerful tool for computing the spectrum of \(T\) in regions containing only eigenvalues, i.e., where the spectrum is discrete. I will introduce an infinite-dimensional analog of Beyn’s method [8], InfBeyn, which is based on
contour integration and adaptively discretizes only linear equations. The driver of this method is the following theorem of Keldysh.

<p>
This theorem allows us to compute eigenvalues inside a region in the complex plane by integrating along the region’s boundary. Let \(\Gamma \) be a closed rectifiable Jordan curve inside \(\Omega \) enclosing \(m\) eigenvalues of \(T(z)\) (counted
via algebraic multiplicity). The approach is summarized&nbsp;Algorithm&nbsp;<a href="paper.html#alg:Beyn's method">1</a> for the case of simple eigenvalues. In the general case, InfBeyn recovers an \(m\times m\) linear pencil with the same
spectral properties as \(T\) inside \(\Gamma \). While previous approaches to infinite-dimensional NEPs are predominantly problem-specific, InfBeyn provides a general method that converges for any holomorphic NEP in regions where the spectrum
is discrete. Moreover, we use techniques from infinite-dimensional randomized numerical linear algebra to prove that the method converges and is stable. Proving convergence and stability is a well-known problem for contour-based methods for
finite-dimensional problems, but it is manageable in infinite dimensions. The following theorem provides the first general convergence theorem for infinite-dimensional NEPs.
</p>
<div class="theoremcontents">

<ul class="list" style="list-style-type:none">


<li>
<p>
<span class="listmarker"><span class="theoremlabel">Theorem 4 (Convergence and stability of InfBeyn) </span></span> <a id="bigthm"></a> Let \({C}(z) = \tilde {\mathcal {U}}^*(\tilde {A}_1 - z \tilde {A}_0)\tilde {V}_0\)
be the generalized eigenvalue problem from Algorithm&nbsp;<a href="paper.html#alg:Beyn's method">1</a>, \(V\) and \(W\) the quasimatrices from Theorem&nbsp;<a href="paper.html#thm:Keldysh">3</a> and \(M=\sup _{z\in \Omega
}\|R(z)\|\), where \(R\) is the holomorphic remainder from Equation&nbsp;<span class="textup">(<a href="paper.html#eq:Keldysh">3</a>)</span>. Let \(\epsilon &gt;0\). Suppose that \(\|A_j-\tilde {A}_0\|\leq \epsilon \), then
\(\Lambda _{\frac {\epsilon }{\|VW^*\|\|VW^*\mathcal {G}\|+M\epsilon }}(T)\subset \Lambda _\epsilon (C)\subset \Lambda _{\frac {\epsilon }{\sigma _m(VW^*)\sigma _m(VW^*\mathcal {G})-M\epsilon }}(T). \)
</p>

</li>

</ul>

</div>

<p>
Hence, InfBeyn robustly computes the eigenvalues of \(T\) provided that the following conditions hold: (1) \(VW^*\) is well-conditioned, (2) \(VW^*\mathcal {G}\) is well-conditioned, (3) the holomorphic remainder is not too large, i.e., \(M\) is not
too big, and (4) \(\epsilon \) is small. The NEP intrinsically determines condition (1). Once condition (1) holds, condition (2) follows in practice, provided that the sketching performed by InfBeyn is adequate at capturing the range of \(A_0\) and
\(A_1\). This can be made precise using tools from randomized numerical linear algebra. Condition (3) measures the regularity of \(T\) inside \(\Omega \). Finally, (4) suggests that InfBeyn’s quadrature rules should be relatively accurate.
</p>

<p>
In short,&nbsp;Theorem&nbsp;<a href="paper.html#bigthm">4</a> establishes that InfBeyn is a robust method for computing the eigenvalues of an NEP within a compact region of the complex plane. I will sketch the proof of this result and show
how it provides a general strategy for analyzing contour methods in both finite and infinite dimensions, along with a variety of examples demonstrating this algorithm in action.
