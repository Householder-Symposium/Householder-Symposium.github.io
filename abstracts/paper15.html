<p>
We consider the problem of finding a nonnegative rank two approximation of an arbitrary nonnegative matrix. We first propose a simple algorithm that computes a new parameterization of all nonnegative factorizations of a given nonnegative matrix
of rank two. We then use this parameterization to construct a suboptimal solution of the nonnegative matrix approximation of rank two of a given nonnegative matrix. We also look at rank two nonnegative approximations with possible symmetry
constraints. We finally apply this to the core-periphery problem in directed graphs.
