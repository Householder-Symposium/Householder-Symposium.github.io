We are offering three options for the Wednesday afternoon excursion. The first is to go to [Taughannock Falls State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/taughannockfalls) for a short walk and to spend time by the lake where we have a pavilion booked, the second is to go to [Robert H. Treman State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/roberttreman/) for a slightly longer hike with more elevation, the third is to go to a winery for the afternoon. Details for the three options follow.

## Taughannock Falls State Park

Our main excursion will be a a trip to [Taughannock Falls State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/taughannockfalls). Here we will lead a short hike to the base of Taughannock Falls (see below; two miles total and essentially flat). For the rest of the afternoon we have a pavilion booked for you to spend time by the lake. We plan to have beer from a local brewary and assorted other snacks/beverages.

For those interested in other activities at the park to complement the walk, there are several options. One is to take another walk up to the falls overlook (see below; note that due to construction near the top of the falls it may not be possible to complete the loop as depicted and you may have to return the way you go up). In addition, it is possible to rent kayaks at the park and go out on the lake. [Paddle-N-More](https://paddlenmore.com/) is the company. Be sure to select Taughannock Falls. Participants are responsible for their own bookings. For planning purposes, we hope to arrive at the park by 2 pm and depart at 5 pm.

## Robert H. Treman State Park

For those interested in a slightly longer hike with more elevation gain we will head to [Robert H. Treman State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/roberttreman/) and hike a loop (see below) that climbs up through the gorge and includes great views of Lucifer Falls. The hike may take around two hours; for those interested there are some options to slightly extend it.

## A winery

The finger lakes is a great cool-climate wine region; particularly for Rieslings and Cabernet Francs. We plan to organize an excursion to a winery on Wednesday afternoon. However, most wineries require detailed information about the number of participants to make a reservation; so, details will be finalized after we know how many folks are interested in this option.
