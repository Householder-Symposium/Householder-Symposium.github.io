Those invited to attend the symposium should plan to arrive on Sunday, 8 June, and depart in the afternoon or evening of Friday, 13 June. The conference will begin with a reception on Sunday evening and conclude with lunch on Friday (provided to go). An important feature of the Householder Symposium is that all participants are committed to staying the entire week. This maximizes the opportunity for informal interactions among participants.

## The Hotel

The symposium will be held at the [Statler Hotel](https://statlerhotel.cornell.edu). Check-in time for the hotel is 16:00 on 8 June and the check-out time is 12:00 on 13 June. If you wish to arrive earlier or depart later you will have to arrange your own room either at the Statler or elsewhere. The Statler is quite busy over the summer so, unfortunately, we are not able to offer a discounted rate for extra nights. There are a number of other reasonable options in Ithaca.

## Getting to the symposium

There are several options for how to travel to Ithaca for the symposium.

### Flying into Ithaca

The most convenient choice if flying is to arrive/depart directly from the airport in [Ithaca (ITH)](https://flyithaca.com/). However, the destinations served are quite limited. If you choose to fly directly into Ithaca the hotel will provide shuttle service to/from the airport and collect flight information at a later date.

### Flying into Syracuse

The airport in [Syracuse (SYR)](https://syrairport.org/) is located roughly one hour away from Ithaca and serves significantly more destinations than Ithaca, albeit still limited to the US. We will provide shuttles from Syracuse airport to Ithaca on Sunday evening and from Ithaca to Syracuse on Friday afternoon. Times will be determined once we collect flight information at a later date.

### Bus from New York City

Cornell runs a bus service from New York City to Ithaca. Information on the schedule and how to book the bus is available on the website for the [Cornell campus-to-campus bus](https://fcs.cornell.edu/departments/transportation-delivery-services/campus-campus-bus-service). The Sage Hall stop at Cornell is directly across the street from the Statler Hotel.

### Driving

For those located in the northeast United States driving may be a convenient option. The Statler Hotel provides valet parking for a small fee.

## Financial support

We have funding available (from NSF) to help support a limited number of early-career researchers who are based in the US. If you are a graduate student or postdoc at a US institution and want to be considered for support please indicate so on the registration form. We anticipate being able to waive the registration fee for a shared room and provide additional funds to, at least partially, cover travel to/from Ithaca.

## Visa applications
